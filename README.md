# OSG-Practice

I often deal with OSG at work but am in the (un)fortunate position of 
having abstractions to work with.

I hope to get more familiar with OSG and the scene graph data structure 
by working through OpenSceneGraph 3.0 Beginner's Guide (authored by Rui 
Wang and Xuelei Qian). I also look forward to configuring CMake for this 
project because this was taken care of in a similar way at work.
